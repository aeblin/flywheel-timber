			<p class="u-textLeft">Before we opened Flywheel in 2012, the space was a bike shop and not quite the sort of place you'd want to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee in. Lucky for us, we had a bunch of lumber and a founder that grew up fixing things on his grandfather's farm, and then his aunt's coffee shop. Most everything in the shop has been hand-crafted; the furniture, the counter, and most importantly the coffee.</p>

					Almost the entire shop is hand-built, providing a unique, out of the mold, look and feel. While we crafted the shop, we were sure to remain conscience of the environment. Aside from the machinery, Flywheel was built using sustainable materials, reclaimed wood, and repurposed items to minimize the impact we have on the environment. We truly believe that we live in the best city in the world and we want to keep it that way.

					At Flywheel, we take our coffee pretty seriously. Every cup of coffee is hand-made on our Hario V60s, and our espresso is pulled to perfection on our customized La Marzocco. Flywheel's mission will always been to serve you the perfect cup of coffee. We grew up in it, and can promise we serve nothing less.
